Work Report on SQLServer [11/02/2021]

• Today, I watched all videos as per schedule given by Vipul sir.
• Learn, the some SQL basics like
	• Joins in that Inner Join, Outer Join, Cross Join
	  In Outer Join there are 3 category
		1. Left Join or Left Outer Join
		2. Right Join or Right Outer Join
		3. Full Join or Full Outer Join
	  In Join we have to used On compoulsory to perform join on tables
	• In cross join we don't need to used On or any clause, It multiply 2 tables data and give result
	• Ex.) If tblPerson contains 10 records and tblState contains 5 records then it gives 50 records as result 
	
	• Self Join :- Self join's main advantage is it we can join the table with it-self other wise it is same as other join's
	  It also support Left Self Join, Right Self Join, Full self Join.

	• Union and UnionAll :- In that Union it removes duplicate records from tables where UnionAll fetch all records.
				Both are perform on from more than one table 
	• Procedure :- In that learn what is procedure, procedure with parameters,and returns value.
	  But if we try to return in procedure it only allows to return integer value we can't return string and any other value.
	  If we want to store result we can used output keyword in parameter and when we call procedure we have to give parameter out/output keyword must required.
	• There are 3 ways to call procedure
		1. procedure_name
		2. Exec procedure_name
		3. Execute procedure_name
	• There are so many advantages of using procedure instead of adhoc query.
		-> Execution retention and re-usability
		-> better maintainability
		-> better security and prevent SQL injection
	• Aggregate Functions :- Count(), Max(), Min(), AVG(), Group By are some examples of Aggregate function
	
	• String Functions :- ASCII(), CHAR(), LTRIM(), RTRIM(), SUBSTRING(), CHARINDEX() are some string functions.

• Also, learn 3 different ways to replace NULL values from table data
	->IsNULL() :- In this pass 2 parameters 1st is table value or 2nd is message you want to print in replacement of NULL
	  IsNULL() is give message when NULL value pass in 1st parameter
	  Ex.) IsNULL(NULL,"No Value found")
	->Case statement :- It is same as Switch case statement 
	  Ex.) CASE WHEN condition1 THEN result1 ELSE RESULT END;
 	->COALESCE() :- COALESCE() function returns the first non-null value in a list.
	  Ex.)COALESCE(val1, val2, val3);

• Perform and Fire Queries in MS-SQL server 2017 from above learned concepts.
• Also learn more in jQuery and refered some videos on youtube.
• And Implement practically.
