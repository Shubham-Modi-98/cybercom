• Today, I watch the introduction to C# videos given by Vipul sir.
• In that learn more C# concepts like
	• Enum
	• List
	• Types and Types Members
	• Access Modifiers
	• Reflection
	• Generics and Override methods

• Also learn difference between Types and Types members 
	-> Types are Class, Struct, Enum, Interfaces.
	-> Where Types Members are fields, methods, constructors, properties.

• Used of #region and #endregion
• In access modifiers internal and public are used in both class,
  where private, protected, public, internal and internal protected are only used by methods and fields. 
• Asked one query related to enum to sir and solved it and also implement it in practical.
