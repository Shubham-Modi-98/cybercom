Work Report on Introduction to C# [03/02/2021]

• Today, I watch the introduction to C# videos given by Vipul sir.
• In that learn more C# concepts like
	• toString() and Convert.toString()
	• string() and stringBuilder()
	• Partial Class, Partial methods
	• Indexers

• Also learn difference between toString() and Convert.toString() 
	-> In, toString() if string contains null,It throws and null value exception,It can't handle null exception.
	-> Where In, Convert.toString() handles null exception and it doesn't throw and exception. 

• Also learn difference between string and stringBuilder()
	-> In string if we modified string it create object every time and call garbage collector to desteoy previous object.
	-> Where In, stringBuilder() it doesn't create new object everytime it modified one time.
	-> string is mutable
	-> Where It is Immutable

• Implement all concepts practical.
