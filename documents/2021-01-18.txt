Work Report on HTML and JavaScript [18/01/2021]

• Today, I watched the videos on Javascript on Google Drive link.
• Today, I learn the more detailed on Prototype chaining, and function chaining
• Object chaining, In that one object function is used by another object function like inheritance

	var shubh = {
	    name: 'Shubham Modi',
	    doy: 1998,
	    age: function() {
	        var curYear = new Date().getFullYear();
	        var curAge = curYear - this.doy;
	        document.writeln(`${this.name} age is ${curAge}.`);
	        console.log(`${this.name} age is ${curAge}.`);
	    }
	}

	//Diff object used diff object funcion
	var teenu = {
	    name: 'Teenu Modi',
	    doy: 1969
	};

	shubh.age();
	teenu.age = shubh.age;
	teenu.age();

• Also, learn diference for loop and for in loop and also implement Practically.
• Learn, more detailed on object and it's property
	var a = {x:'ABC'};
	for(var i=0; i<5; i++)
	{
	    console.log(a.x);
	    console.log(a);
	}
	for (X in a) {
	    document.writeln(a.x);
	    document.writeln(X.a);
	    document.writeln(X);    
	    console.log(a.x);
	    console.log(X.a);
	    console.log(X);
	}

• Learn the difference between feature of Array in ES5 and ES6.
• Watched and Search some topics which contains basic HTML and JS:
	FieldSet and Legend and Used in Form

• Also learn how to create registration form Fieldset, Dropdown and Redirect on another page.
• Then completed HTML Practices given by Pritee Mam.
• Attend the meeting taken by Pritee mam and ask some doubt and solved doubts and give answer of their questions.

• Prototype chaninig snippet
	// Function Prototype Chaining
	var Person = function(name,doy) {
	    this.name = name;
	    this.doy = doy;
	}
	Person.prototype.calcAge = 
	function() {
	    var curYear = new Date().getFullYear();
	    var curAge = curYear - this.doy;
	    document.writeln(`${this.name} age is ${curAge}.`);
	    console.log(`${this.name} age is ${curAge}.`);
	}
	virat = {
	    name: 'Virat Kohli',
	    doy: 1988
	};
	var vk = new Person(virat.name,virat.doy);
	vk.calcAge();
	var chris = new Person('Chris Hemsworth',1983).calcAge();
