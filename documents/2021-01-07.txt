Work Report on Git [07/01/2021]

• Today, I watch the some git tutorials on youtube.
• Today, I learn how to rename or clone branch on github.
	• Start by switching to the local branch which you want to rename  	
		git checkout <old_branch>

	• Rename the local branch, At this point, you have renamed the local branch.
		git branch -m <new_branch>

	• Push the <new_name> local branch and reset the upstream branch
		git push origin -u <new_branch>

	• Delete the <old_name> remote branch
		git push origin --delete <old_branch>

• If you wnat to know what kind of changes done and commit and what difference of old commit and new commit
	git show <commit_id>

• git branch <branch_name> :- It creates new branch in repo.
• git branch -d <branch_name> :- It deletes your branch from repo.
• git status :- It shows the status of modification is done or not in local from remote.

• If you merge 2 branch you have to switch to main or origin branch and then fire command
	git merge <branch_name>

• If you want to Undo commit [Not recommended for Using this command]
	git reset --hard HEAD^ 
• If you want to show modification after undo then used log and take below commit id and executr command
	git reset --soft <commit_id>
• Difference between soft and hard:-
	In hard you don't get changes difference of your commit but In soft you can check or see the modification diff.

• If you want to changes stages then you have to used
	git restore --stage <file_name>
• you want to fully unstage your file used:
	git restore <file_name>

• If you want to sync local commit history and remote commit history used pull:
	git pull

• Learn used of gitignore, when we have to used .gitignore, how to work.
